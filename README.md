**Authors:** Jacob Buckley
<pre>
small java.net chat server and client
right now the client only flushes when it sends data which leads to really odd message orders.


ToDo:
need to either multi-thread the client to continiously flush or set up some kinda timer system.
make it pretty and formal.
setup maven efficiently
Integrate into my uno project
